                        A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one
                        or more cooked patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or
                        bun.

                            Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J.
                            Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece
                            of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It
                            proved so successful that, as they grew through franchising, they required all of their
                            franchises to carry the device.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the Jacksonville chain kept expanding, two friends named James McLamore and David R.
                            Edgerton, both alumni of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, were seeking
                            an opportunity to open their own business. McLamore had visited the original hamburger stand
                            belonging to Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino, California, and sensing potential in
                            their innovative assembly line-based production system, decided to open a similar
                            operation.
